# This script is a master script that controls the fan speed of Dell laptops.
# It uses the i8kmon daemon to control the fan speed based on the temperature of the CPU.

# The i8kmon daemon is a program that monitors the temperature of the CPU and controls the fan speed accordingly.
# It is part of the i8kutils package, which is available in the official repositories of most Linux distributions.
# i8kutils Fan Control for DELL laptops: is a collection of utilities for Dell laptops that use the i8k hardware monitoring driver.

#check dependencies for i8kutils package and install them if not present
if ! dpkg -l | grep -q i8kutils; then
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y i8kutils
fi

# if i8kutils is not installed, exit the script
if ! dpkg -l | grep -q i8kutils; then
    echo "i8kutils package is not installed. EXITING..."
    exit 1
fi

#The temperature points at which the fan changes speed can be adjusted in the configuration file /etc/i8kutils/i8kmon.conf. Only three fans speeds are supported (high, low, and off)
#The default configuration file is /etc/i8kmon.conf. The configuration file is divided into three sections: the general section, the temperature section, and the fan section.
#The general section contains general settings for the i8kmon daemon, such as the interval at which the temperature is checked and the interval at which the fan speed is updated.
#The temperature section contains the temperature points at which the fan speed changes.
#The fan section contains the fan speeds for each temperature point.

# installation as a service
#i8kmon can be started automatically by starting/enabling i8kmon.service.
# The i8kmon daemon can be started as a service by creating a systemd unit file.

#BIOS overriding fan control
#Some newer laptops have BIOS fan control in place which will override the OS level fan control. \
#To test if this the case, run i8kmon with verbose mode in a command line, make sure the CPU is idle, then see if the fan is turned off or turned down accordingly.
#If fancontrol will not work on your system, use the ignore_dmi=1 kernel module parameter to load dell_smm_hwmon
